A bridge between Feishu (Lark) private chat and local coding agents. Talk to Claude Code (or Codex / opencode / pi / Kimi / DSH) from Feishu — the agent reads/writes files and runs commands in a local directory you pick, with execution streamed live into a single CardKit 2.0 card.

Designed for a single-user, peer-to-peer private chat. The agent's system prompt is never modified.

## ⚠️ Security Warning (read first)

This tool turns Feishu messages directly into local agent executions. **Out of the box, agents run without approval prompts**: Claude defaults to `bypassPermissions` (no approval card), but that permission mode is **configurable** — set it to anything other than `bypassPermissions` (`default` / `acceptEdits` / `auto` / `dontAsk` / `plan`) to enable interactive approval, where high-risk actions wait for your confirmation on the Feishu card. Codex uses the **app-server approval mode** (default `approvalPolicy=on-request` — command execution requires your confirmation on the Feishu card, sandbox defaults to `workspace-write`); Kimi defaults to `manual` (per-action approval; note that since kimi 0.40, `yolo` means Ask-When-Needed rather than allow-everything — use `auto` for fully unattended, no-approval execution); other agents run with their CLI defaults. **In any mode**, agents can read and write the local directories you specify. You MUST:

- **Use it only in your own private (p2p) chat.** Never add the bot to any group chat; never let anyone else talk to it.
- Restrict the app's visibility to **yourself only** in the Feishu Open Platform.
- Don't run it on a machine holding data you can't afford to lose; prefer a dedicated user / machine / container.
- Keep credentials such as `appSecret` in your local `config.yaml` only — **never commit them anywhere**.

In approval mode (Claude, Codex, Kimi), an approval card arrives before a command runs — approve or reject it right in Feishu:

## Prerequisites

- OS: macOS / Linux / Windows 10+ (native Windows support is verified on real hardware, with behavior matching macOS/Linux)
- Node.js 20+ ([Bun](https://bun.sh/) for development)
- A Feishu custom app (either way): scan-to-create (a QR code pops up in the terminal on first launch; scan it with the Feishu app to create the app and write credentials automatically); or create one manually in the Open Platform — enable bot capability, subscribe to `im.message.receive_v1` and `card.action.trigger` via **long connection** (WebSocket, no public address needed), with at least the `im:message` scope.
- Claude Code CLI installed locally and logged in once in a terminal (`claude` → browser OAuth). Same idea for other agents (codex / opencode / pi / kimi): install the corresponding CLI first. DSH connects to a local DSH Web Host via HTTP+WebSocket (no local subprocess), default address `http://127.0.0.1:3080`.

## Installation

Option 1: npm / npx (no clone needed):

```bash
npx lark-remote          # run directly
# or install globally
npm install -g lark-remote
lark-remote
```

Option 2: from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bungabungawoda/lark-remote.git
cd lark-remote
bun install
bun run build
bun install -g "$(pwd)"  # install globally as lark-remote command (bun parses `.` as an empty package name; use an absolute path)
```

## Configuration

On first launch, if no Feishu credentials are found: an interactive terminal enters the scan-to-create wizard (a QR code is printed; scan it with the Feishu app to create the app, write credentials, and continue startup); non-interactive environments generate a template at `~/.lark-remote/config.yaml` and exit — fill in your credentials and restart. See [`docs/en/usage.md`](docs/en/usage.md) for all fields. Key options:

```yaml
feishu:
  appId: cli_xxx
  appSecret: xxx

# default agent: claude | codex | opencode | pi | kimi | dsh (default: claude)
defaultAgent: claude

claude:
  model: claude-opus-4-8
  effort: medium            # low | medium | high | xhigh | max
  permissionMode: bypassPermissions  # Claude official --permission-mode: default | acceptEdits | auto | bypassPermissions | manual | dontAsk | plan (switchable via /config card; anything other than bypassPermissions enables approval)
  stopGraceMs: 5000

logging:
  level: info               # debug | info | warn | error

idle:
  watchdogMinutes: 15       # 0 disables the idle timeout auto-stop
```

Override the config directory with `--config-dir <path>`; override the Claude settings path with `--settings <path>` or the `CLAUDE_SETTINGS_PATH` environment variable.

## Running

```bash
lark-remote                                     # after global install / via npx
bun run dev                                     # development (run TS directly with bun)
bun run build && node dist/index.js             # run the compiled output

# CLI flags
lark-remote --config-dir ~/.lark-remote-test    # custom config dir (multiple instances on one machine)
lark-remote --settings ~/.claude/settings.json  # specify Claude settings file
```

lark-remote prints nothing to the terminal after startup; logs go to `~/.lark-remote/logs/YYYY-MM-DD/lark-remote-<pid>.log` (rotated daily, one subdirectory per day). Only one `lark-remote` instance is allowed per `configDir` — a duplicate start fails with the existing pid. After connecting to Feishu, a startup notification (with start time and pid) is sent to the most recent private chat.

Each agent run creates one CardKit 2.0 card that updates in place with thinking, body text, and tool summaries in real time.
Timestamps are read from the JSONL and shown in local time as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` for thinking, body, tool call/result, and session history events.
The card clearly shows completion, error, interruption, or idle timeout at the end; the in-card "⏹ Stop" button is equivalent to `/stop`.
Cards use a lossy rolling summary — very long histories are not kept in full.
Your original message also gets an emoji reaction: `Typing` while the run is in progress, then the terminal-state emoji at the end — `Done` (finished), `ERROR` (failed), `Alarm` (idle timeout), or `SHHH` (you stopped it with `/stop`). `!` bash commands always end with `Done`.

## Commands

| Command | Alias | Behavior |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `/help` | `/h` | Command list |
| `/cd <path>` | - | Switch agent working directory (`~`, absolute/relative; clears the session) |
| `/ls [dir\|file]` | - | Directory/file card; click a directory to browse, click a file ≤30MB to send it to Feishu; paginates beyond 30 entries with a page-number jump input, and current-level entries can be filtered by keyword. Passing a file path lists that file itself |
| `/download <path>` | `/d` | Send a local file straight to the chat (`~`, absolute/relative paths, 30MB cap) |
| `/ws save\|use\|remove` | - | Named directory aliases (`/ws` lists by default, filterable by alias name or path keyword) |
| `/resume [agent] [N\|id]` | `/r` | List/switch agent sessions for the current directory (card) |
| `/active` | - | List all running sessions |
| `/new` | - | Clear the current session (keeps cwd) |
| `/status` | `/s` | Current directory, session, model, process status |
| `/stop` | `/t` | Kill the current agent process (SIGKILL) |
| `/ps` | - | Whether a process is running |
| `/restart` | - | In-place lark-remote self-restart (new process takes over with the same config) |
| `/clone [name]` | - | Clone lark-remote: copies the current config into a new directory and walks you through creating a brand-new Feishu app by QR scan; on success it binds, syncs state, and launches the new instance |
| `/config get\|set` | `/c` | View/change runtime config (agent-aware card) |
| `/order save\|list\|edit` | `/o` | Save, list, or edit frequently used prompts |
| `!<cmd>` | - | Run a bash command with streaming card output (bypasses the serial queue) |
| `/exit` | `/e` | Exit lark-remote |

Any message not starting with `/` is forwarded to the current default agent.

**Clone the bridge (`/clone`)**: to run an independent bridge instance next to another project directory, send `/clone <name>` — the current config directory is cloned to `<configDir>-<name>` (everything except the Feishu credentials), a QR code is sent into the chat as an image to create a brand-new Feishu app, and once you scan it the new app is bound automatically with workspace aliases, saved prompts, working directory, and session state carried over; the new instance launches itself and is ready to chat. You can also hit the "/clone" button on the `/help` card. See [docs/en/usage.md](docs/en/usage.md) for details.
